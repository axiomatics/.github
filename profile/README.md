# Tackling Authorization

Axiomatics provides a high-performance and flexible fine-grained authorization engine built for developers and refined over the last 15 years. Its domain-specific language, the Abbreviated Language for Authorization (ALFA), makes it easy to implement authorization policies that can grow and evolve to any use case, at any scale including role-based access control (RBAC), attribute-based access control (ABAC), and relationship-based access control (RelBAC).

Axiomatics is the editor of the OASIS XACML 3.0 standard, the creator of the Abbreviated Language For Authorization (ALFA), and a founding member of the AuthZEN Working Group under the helm of the OpenID Foundation.
